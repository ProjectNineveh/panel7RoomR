# Metadata 

Gypsum wall relief panel with large dogs; carved; the man or eunuch holding the lead is beardless, but his hair ends in a row of plaits, in a simpler style than that of his companion; men leading mules in this procession have similar plaits, which may have been worn by people of lower status at the Assyrian court. The Assyrian eunuch in front is carrying a net and stakes.

Height: 157 centimetres Width: 118 centimetres Thickness: 10 centimetres (extant)
